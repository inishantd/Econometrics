The main aim of this project is to finding the relationship among foreign direct
investment, inflation rate, unemployment rate, and exchange rate toward the
economic growth based on the multiple linear regression analysis. The study aims
to explore how these macroeconomic variables affect GDP and each other, and to
identify the factors that contribute to economic growth and development. The
analysis will be based on empirical data and will utilize various econometric
techniques to measure the causal relationships between the variables
